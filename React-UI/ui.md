## React-Typescript UI Folder

This folder contains the *TypeScript* workspace for the *React* UI components. The structure includes a `public` folder, which holds the `index.html` file responsible for loading the application, and a `src` folder, which contains the core application logic such as components, utilities, and other modules. This modular organization ensures scalability and maintainability of the project.
